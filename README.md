# Serverless Node.js Starter

Currently built using the serverless starter kit.

A Serverless starter that adds ES6, TypeScript, serverless-offline, linting, environment variables, and unit test support.

[Serverless Node.js Starter](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter) uses the [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) plugin and the [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) plugin. It supports:

- **Generating optimized Lambda packages with Webpack**
- **Using ES6 or TypeScript in your handler functions**
- **Run API Gateway locally**
  - Use `serverless offline start`
- **Support for unit tests**
  - Run `npm test` to run your tests
- **Sourcemaps for proper error messages**
  - Error message show the correct line numbers
  - Works in production with CloudWatch
- **Lint your code with ESLint**
- **Add environment variables for your stages**
- **No need to manage Webpack or Babel configs**

### Demo

A demo version of this service is hosted on AWS - [`https://z6pv80ao4l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`](https://z6pv80ao4l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)

And here is the ES6 source behind it

```javascript
export const hello = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `Go Serverless v1.0! ${await message({
        time: 1,
        copy: "Your function executed successfully!",
      })}`,
      input: event,
    }),
  };
};

const message = ({ time, ...rest }) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(`${rest.copy} (with a delay)`);
    }, time * 1000)
  );
```

### Requirements

- Install the Serverless Framework
- Configure your AWS CLI

### Installation

Install the Node.js packages

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

To run a function on your local

```bash
$ serverless invoke local --function hello
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

```bash
$ serverless offline start
```

Deploy your project

```bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

```bash
$ serverless deploy function --function hello
```

#### Running Tests

Run your tests using

```bash
$ npm test
```

We use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).
